\section{Introduction}
\label{section:intro}
This report covers the source code for Lab 2 and the following important concepts that are present in the code:
%Explain the mechanism of changing the LED intensity by discussing what happens in the
%source code. Explain the key functionalities such as the duty cycle and others.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Duty cycle
    \item PWM (Pulse Width modulation)
    \item ADC (Analog to digital converter) 
    \item UART (Universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter)
\end{itemize}
